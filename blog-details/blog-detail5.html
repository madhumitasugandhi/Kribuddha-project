    <h2>Start Your Day with Morning Yoga</h2>
    <p>Morning time is pure, quiet, and powerful. It is the best time to connect with yourself. Practicing yoga in the morning not only improves your body but also brings peace to your mind. It wakes up every muscle, stretches your spine, and fills you with fresh energy for the day.</p>

    <p>Whether you're new to yoga or already doing it, a proper morning yoga routine can help you feel active, focused, and relaxed. Even a short session of yoga in the morning can make your whole day better.</p>

    <blockquote>
      “A yogi should constantly practice yoga in solitude, self-controlled and free from desires and possessions. This is the path to inner peace.” — Bhagavad Gita, Chapter 6, Verse 10
    </blockquote>

    <h2>Why Morning is the Best Time for Yoga</h2>
    <p>The early morning hours—called Brahma Muhurta—are considered ideal. This is the time when the body is fresh, the stomach is empty, and the mind is clear. The air is pure, and distractions are few. The best time to do yoga in the morning is between 5:30 AM and 7:30 AM.</p>

    <h2>How to Start Morning Yoga as a Beginner</h2>
    <p>If you’re new to yoga, don’t stress. Start small and build gradually. Begin by setting a fixed time for your yoga practice, wear comfortable clothes, and start with 20 minutes. Slowly increase your practice as your body adapts.</p>

    <h3>Easy Morning Yoga Poses</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Cat-Cow Pose (Marjariasana & Bitilasana)</li>
      <li>Downward Dog (Adho Mukha Svanasana)</li>
      <li>Cobra Pose (Bhujangasana)</li>
      <li>Child’s Pose (Balasana)</li>
      <li>Seated Forward Bend (Paschimottanasana)</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>A Simple Morning Yoga Sequence</h2>
    <p>Start with 5 minutes of breathing, then move into Cat-Cow, Downward Dog, Cobra, and Forward Bend. End with a short meditation for 3–5 minutes.</p>

    <h2>Morning Yoga for Flexibility and Weight Loss</h2>
    <p>For flexibility: Triangle Pose, Low Lunge, Butterfly Pose.</p>
    <p>For weight loss: Sun Salutation, Plank Pose, Boat Pose, Chair Pose.</p>

    <h2>Yoga for Everyone – Kids, Adults & Seniors</h2>
    <p>Kids can practice fun poses, adults benefit from stress relief, and seniors should focus on gentle stretches and breathing exercises.</p>

    <h2>How to Build and Stick to a Morning Yoga Habit</h2>
    <p>Set a consistent time, keep your mat ready, avoid distractions, and practice daily—even if only for 10 minutes.</p>

    <h2>Why Ekam Yoga is Your Best Morning Partner</h2>
